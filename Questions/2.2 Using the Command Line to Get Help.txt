Guided Exercises

Use the man command to find out what each command does:

Command	Description
ls
Display the contents of a directory.

R:
cat
Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.

cut
Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output.

cd
Change the current directory to dir

cp
Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY

mv
Rename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

mkdir
Create the DIRECTORY(ies), if they do not already exist.

touch
Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.

wc
Print  newline,  word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total line if more than one FILE is specified.
A word is a non-zero-length sequence of characters delimited by white space.


passwd
The passwd utility is used to update user's authentication token(s).

rm
This manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.

rmdir
Remove the DIRECTORY(ies), if they are empty.

more
is  a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.
This version is especially primitive.  Users should realize that less(1) provides more(1)
emulation plus extensive enhancements.

less
Less is a program similar to more (1), but which allows backward movement in the file as well as forward movement.
Also, less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts
up faster than text editors like vi (1).  Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on
a variety  of terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.
(On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)

whereis
whereis  locates  the  binary, source and manual files for the specified command names.

head
Print the first 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.

tail
Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.

sort
Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.

tr
Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output.

chmod
changes the file mode bits of each given file according to mode

grep
grep  searches  for  PATTERN  in  each  FILE.


Open the ls info page and identify the MENU.
What options do you have?
R:
* Which files are listed::
* What information is listed::
* Sorting the output::
* Details about version sort::
* General output formatting::
* Formatting file timestamps::
* Formatting the file names::

Find the option that allows you to sort the output by modification time.
R:
ls -t

Display the path to the first 3 README files. Use the man command to identify the correct option for locate.
R:
locate -n 3 README
locate -l 3 README

Create a file called test in your home directory. Find its absolute path with the locate command.
R:
cd
touch test
updatedb
find test | grep home

Did you find it immediately? What did you have to do in order for locate to find it?
R:
No.
Is necessary update database with command updatedb

Search for the test file that you previously created, using the find command.
What syntax did you use and what is the absolute path ?
R:
find ~ -name test
find . -name test

Explorational Exercises

There is one command in the table above that doesn’t have a man page.
Which one is it and why do you think that the command doesn’t have a man page?
R:
Command cp because is a shell builtin

Using the commands in the table above, create the following file tree.
The names that start with a capital are Directories and the ones in lower case are files.

User

|   ├──Hello
|   |   ├──hey2
|   |   ├──helloa

|   ├──Music
|   └──Songs
|       ├──collection1
|       └──collection2
├── Test
|   └── passa

R:
# Create folders
cd
mkdir -p \
Documents/Hello Documents/World \
Downloads/Music Downloads/Songs \
Test

# Create files
cd
cd Documents/Hello/
touch hey2 helloa ola5
cd
cd Documents/World/
touch earth9
cd
cd Downloads/Songs/
touch collection{1..2}
cd
cd Test/
touch passa
cd
touch test

Display on the screen the present working directory, including the subfolders.
ls -R
tree -U

Search within the tree for all files that end with a number.
R:
find . -name *[0-9]
find ~ -name "*[0-9]"
locate "*[0-9]"

Remove the entire directory tree with a single command.
R:
rm -r Documents Downloads Test test
