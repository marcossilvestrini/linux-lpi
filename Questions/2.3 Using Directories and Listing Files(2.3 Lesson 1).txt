Guided Exercises

For each of the following paths, identify whether it is absolute or relative:

R:

/home/user/Downloads
Absolute

../Reports
Relative

/var
Absolute

docs
Relative

/
Absolute

Observe the following file structure.
Note: Directories end with a slash (/) when tree is invoked with the -F option.
You will need elevated privileges in order to run the tree command on the root (/) directory.
The following is example output and is not indicative of a full directory structure.
Use it to answer the following questions:

$ sudo tree -F /

/
├── etc/
│   ├── network/
│   │   └── interfaces
│   ├── systemd/
│   │   ├── resolved.conf
│   │   ├── system/
│   │   ├── system.conf
│   │   ├── user/
│   │   └── user.conf
│   └── udev/
│       ├── rules.d/
│       └── udev.conf
└── home/
    ├── lost+found/
    └── user/
        └── Documents/

12 directories, 5 files
Use this structure to answer the following questions.

A user enters the following commands:

$ cd /etc/udev
$ ls -a
What will be the output of the ls -a command?
R:
. .. rules.d udev.conf

Enter the shortest possible command for each of the following:
Your current location is root (/).
Enter the command to navigate to lost+found within the home directory (example):
$ cd home/lost+found
R:
cd ~/lost+found

Your current location is root (/).
Enter the command to navigate to the directory named /etc/network/.
cd /etc/network

Your current location is /home/user/Documents/.
Navigate to the directory named /etc/.
cd /etc

Your current location is /etc/systemd/system/.
Navigate to the directory named /home/user/.
cd
cd ~

Consider the following commands:

$ pwd
/etc/udev/rules.d
$ cd ../../systemd/user
$ cd ..
$ pwd
What is the output of the final pwd command?
/etc/systemd/

Explorational Exercises

Suppose a user has entered the following commands:

$ mkdir "this is a test"
$ ls
this is a test
What cd command would allow you to enter this directory?

cd this\ is\ a\ test
cd "this is a test"

Try this again, but after typing in cd this, press the TAB key.
What is now displayed on the prompt?
cd this\ is\ a\ test

This is an example of autocompletion, which is an invaluable tool not only for saving time,
but for preventing spelling errors.

Try to create a directory whose name contains a \ character.
Display the directory’s name with ls and delete the directory.
mkdir \\foo
ls \\foo
rmdir \\foo
